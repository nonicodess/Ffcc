    <h2> History and Mission</h2>
    <p>In the wake of a fire or disaster, 
        people are injured, homes and families are destroyed and lives changed forever. 
        The firefighters charitable foundation (FFCF) know first hand the pain and suffering that can be caused in an instant.

        to support other disaster or prevention related charities and institutions, and volunteer fire departments. 
        FFCF also has a nationwide volunteer brigade that acts as our eyes and ears to identify those in  critical need.
